ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* CleanSpec.mk
* MODULE_LICENSE_APACHE2
* NOTICE
* ext\
* ext\Android.mk
* ext\src\
* ext\src\com\
* ext\src\com\mediatek\
* ext\src\com\mediatek\launcher2\
* ext\src\com\mediatek\launcher2\ext\
* ext\src\com\mediatek\launcher2\ext\AllAppsListExt.java
* ext\src\com\mediatek\launcher2\ext\IAllAppsListExt.java
* ext\src\com\mediatek\launcher2\ext\ISearchButtonExt.java
* ext\src\com\mediatek\launcher2\ext\SearchButtonExt.java
* fill_screens.py
* print_db.py
* proguard.flags
* 验版本流程v1.0.0.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* ic_app_calculator.PNG => ic_app_calculator.png
* ic_app_ecloud.PNG => ic_app_ecloud.png

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
